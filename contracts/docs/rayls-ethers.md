# Rayls Ethers Client

The client is used to create an abstraction layer between the ethers connections to the Ven (CommitChain and Pls) on each Smart Contract

To utilize the Rayls Ethers Client, ensure the following configuration and deployment files are correctly set up for your environment:

- `config.[env].json`: Contains environment-specific settings such as chain IDs, URLs, account information, and participant settings.
- `deployments.[env].json`: Holds deployment addresses for smart contracts relevant to the environment.

## Adding a new contract

#### Taking for example the ParticipantStorage contract which requires metadata (like the role) to register each Pl.

```json
{
  "id": "A",
  "chainId": 1339,
  "url": "http://localhost:3000",
  "wsUrl": "ws://localhost:3000",
  "accounts": [
    "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80"
  ],
  "participant": {
    "role": 0
  }
}
```

### Extending the Configs

#### Config

Since the **Role** is necessary to be know beforehand, we can add it as a required param in the config.[env].json file by going into **config/schema.ts** which has the config schema that is used as a validation for the tool.

This can be extended for our use case by adding it in the PlSchema like so:

```typescript
const PlSchema = {
  type: 'object',

  properties: {
    id: { type: 'string' },
    chainId: { type: 'number' },
    url: { type: 'string' },
    wsUrl: { type: 'string' },
    accounts: { type: 'array', items: { type: 'string' } },

    /**
     *  Adding this will ensure the participant will be present in the config
     */
    participant: {
      type: 'object',

      properties: {
        role: { type: 'number' },
      },
    },
  },
} as const;
```

**The `as const` is used to later extract the types using AJV, this is mandatory or types will be lost or converted to any**

#### Deployments Config

After deploying the ParticipantStorage, we might want to save it's address to the deployments config and make it auto initialize the contract when it's present.

To this we go into **deployments/schema.ts** which has the deployments config schema which has the same purpose as **config/schema.ts** but for managing deployments

<br/>

**When adding a new contract address, make sure it has the same name as the Contract!!**

This is because the name is used behind the scenes to import the ABI using Hardhat. Like so:
`ethers.getContractAt(name, address)`

**Attention** ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†

```typescript
const plSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  optionalProperties: {
    EndpointAddress: { type: 'string' },
    /*
     * Add here if optional
     */
  },
  properties: {
    MessageDispatcher: { type: 'string' },
    /*
     * Added here since it's mandatory
     */
    ParticipantStorage: { type: 'string' },
  },
} as const;
```

Now you should be able to both read and write configurations into the Rayls Config

### Extending ethers

After this we might want to extend the **ethers client** so for this we go into **ethers/\*.ts** which contains all the mappings done for the CommitChain and each Pl.
Giving the example of the **accounts** property, we can use it to abstract the initialization of the wallets.

```typescript
{
  signers: cfg.accounts.map((privateKey) => {
    const wallet = new ethersInstance.Wallet(privateKey).connect(provider);
    const signer = new ethersInstance.NonceManager(wallet);
    return signer;
  });
}
```
